# EVCN

To create a site that calls on the google Maps API and or Google Places API to allow users to locate services in their immediate
area.

I have created a site that allows users to locate Electric Vehicle charging stations near by and provide details of privately owned chargers to add to the EVCN.

## UX

The site is aimed at EV owners with and without privately owned charging stations on their properties. The site will find the users location and provide the user with all available charging stations, from public charging stations to private charging stations. The site also allows users to add their own charging station to EVCN via email.

- As a user type, I want to see all available charging stations that are near me.

## Features

### Existing Features

EVCN is a super easy cluster free site. The site is a one page site, broken up into three main sections, About EVCN Map and Contact Us

#### About

Eye catching about section providing a brief overview of what the site has to offer.

#### EVCN Map

EVCN Map section providing instant feedback on the users location.

#### Contact Us

Contact us section requires the user to input their name email address and details on their charging station.

### Features Left to Implement

#### Infowindow

In future I would like to implement a popup info window for every marker of the search results to show the name address and type of charging station.

#### Side panel with brief description

The side panel will display name address type of charging station number of chargers, avaiablitiy of chargers and a rating of the station. A get direction with way points button.

#### Members sign in section

I would also like to add a sign up and login button that would give members access to a list of privately owed chargers that the members could use when they are available.
